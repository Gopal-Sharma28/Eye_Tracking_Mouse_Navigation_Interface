# Eye Tracking Mouse Navigation Interface

## Project Overview
This project is an eye tracking mouse navigation interface that utilizes computer vision techniques to control the mouse cursor based on the user's eye movements.

## Features
- **Real-time Eye Tracking**: Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to track eye movements.
- **Mouse Control**: Allows users to control the mouse cursor using their eyes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for users.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI

## Installation Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
   ```

## Usage Instructions
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python eye_tracking_mouse_navigation_interface.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the eye tracking.

## Input Features
- **Eye Position**: The position of the user's eyes is tracked to determine cursor movement.
- **Calibration**: Users may need to calibrate their eye movements for accurate tracking.

## Output Explanation
- **Mouse Cursor Movement**: The cursor will move based on the user's eye movements.
- **Feedback**: Visual feedback may be provided to indicate successful tracking.

## Real-World Applications
This project can be utilized in accessibility technology, allowing individuals with mobility impairments to interact with computers using their eyes.

## Limitations
- The accuracy of the tracking may vary based on lighting conditions and camera quality.
- The system may require calibration for different users.

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional features for gesture recognition.
- Enhance the user interface for better user experience.
- Add functionality for users to customize settings.
